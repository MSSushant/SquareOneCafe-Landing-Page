# SquareOneCafe-Landing-Page

I crafted a landing page for 'Square One Cafe,' which is a charming and modern restaurant. Utilizing HTML, CSS, and a touch of JavaScript, I aimed to create an online presence that reflects the cafe's welcoming and contemporary vibe.

I began with the HTML structure, laying out a navigation bar, a hero section with an image of the cafe's best-selling dish, an about section that tells the story of the cafe, a menu showcase, a gallery of the cafe ambiance, customer testimonials, and a footer with contact information.

For styling, I used CSS to create a warm and inviting color palette that complements the cafe's aesthetic. I emphasized readability with a combination of serif and sans-serif fonts that mirror the casual yet sophisticated feel of 'Square One Cafe.' Responsiveness was a priority, so I ensured the layout adjusted seamlessly across different devices.

JavaScript was employed sparingly to add interactivity, such as a dynamic menu that filters dishes by category, a photo gallery slider, and a form to reserve a table, which validates input and confirms the reservation without reloading the page.

My objective throughout this project was not only to make the landing page visually appealing but also to ensure it was user-friendly, providing potential customers a glimpse into the experience theyâ€™d have at 'Square One Cafe.'
